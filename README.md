# Creating and Interpreting Segmentation Maps for Image Analysis

In computer vision, segmentation is not just a tool but a lens that reveals the finer details. Unlike bounding boxes that merely surround objects, segmentation maps delve deeper, offering pixel-level granularity to capture the subtleties that elevate image analysis.

In this notebook, we’ll journey through the transformative power of segmentation maps, focusing on their applications in image analysis. Using FiftyOne and the KITTI dataset, we’ll explore practical techniques to create, interpret, and optimize segmentation maps for real-world use cases.
